\abstract{The Parallel Distributed Processing (PDP) approach to cognition assumes that active mental representations are distributed over many neural populations. It is known that distributed representations can be acquired through domain general learning mechanisms to economically encode graded similarity structure that supports generalization and is robust to disruption. Until recently, however, the PDP hypothesis has not strongly influenced functional  brain imaging, which has, for historical and methodological reasons, tended to adopt modular 
assumptions about how the brain encodes information. Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) relaxes these assumptions, but the most common methods are only sensitive to quite localized similarity structure, either within a searchlight or predetermined regions of interest. In this paper we leverage a recent innovation in multivariate analysis, the ``sparse overlapping sets Lasso'' (SOSLasso), to seriously consider whether distributed representations like those that arise in PDP models are also employed in the brain.By applying SOSLasso and univariate methods to data generated by artificial neural networks where the representational structure is known, we show how and why reliable univariate results can systematically miss important distributed patterns where SOSLasso preferentially identifies such patterns. We then apply both methods to real brain imaging data, and show that, at least in some domains of interest, the underlying representations appear to be distributed in ways that are highly consistent with the assumptions adopted by the PDP framework.}

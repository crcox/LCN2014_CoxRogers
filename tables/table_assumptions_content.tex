\newcommand{\Description}[1]{
 \switch[#1]
  \case{=1} A given unit within a particular representation will respond to various stimuli in the same way across individuals. %
  \case{=2} In any individual, anatomically neighboring units likely contribute to the same representation. %
  \case{=3} Across individuals, the units that contribute to a given representation will be found in similar anatomical locations. %
  \case{=4} The information coded by a unit activation does ot depend on the activation of other units. %
  \case{=5} Of all units measures, only a small proportion will be involved in the representation of interest. %
  \case{=6} The responses of units within a representation are highly correlated. %

\begin{letter}{Dear Dr. Olaf Hauk,} 
\opening{The following is our submission for the special issue of {\it Language, Cognition, and Neuroscience} that you are editing, entitled ``Representing mental representations: Neuroscientific and computational approaches to information processing in the brain''.}

The thesis of the work is that distributed representations may be systematically overlooked in neuroimaging data analyzed in the most common ways, i.e., by univariate contrast and multivariate searchlight methods. These two common methods, two relatively state of the art methods (LASSO and Ridge regression), and our novel method (SOS LASSO) are applied to simulated datasets where the underlying structure is known. We lay out the assumptions of each method, and demonstrate how they lead to systematically different solutions, in support of the thesis. We go on to demonstrate that the four multivariate methods lead to drastically different solutions on a real fMRI dataset.

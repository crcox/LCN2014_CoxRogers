Dear Committee Members,

Thank you for reviewing this work as part of preliminary examination. While I am comfortable calling this work my own, the paper was decidedly co-authored by Tim Rogers who provided invaluable guidance and helped craft my initial efforts into a more polished finished project. In light of this, I would like to sort out what can be appropriately credited to me from Tim's contributions.

The neural network modeling and subsequent analyses were all my own work.  The seed-idea of training neural networks and treating their activation patterns as neural activity sampled from different anatomical regions was Tim's, but the development of the idea into an application was a joint effort and the implementation was my work.

Interpreting the results obtained by applying the various analysis techniques to the neural networks required deep knowledge of which Tim was able to provide and also the computational methods 

The writing process was iterative: I always wrote the initial drafts, and Tim would provide feedback. At early stages, feedback was more high-level which would require restructuring and re-drafting. If conceptual content was lacking, I would need to fill it in myself. At later stages in the writing process, feedback often took the form of word-smithing and clarification.

The section on which Tim and I iterated the most, aside from the introduction,
